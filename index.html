          <p>Cats are amazing!</p>
          <p>Cats Are Quieter. They are essentially self-cleaning machines. They're softer, sweeter, and smarter. Just look at these pictures!</p>

            <h2>Team Dogs</h2>
            <p>Dogs are the best</p>
            <p>Dogs are the protector. They are loyal and will be by your side forever. You can trust them with your life! Just look at them.</p>
            <p>Any dog owner will know that walking your pet is a sure fire way to start conversations with fellow animal lovers. In a world where people are increasingly isolated, that is a wonderful thing.</p>
            <p>Whether theyâ€™re accidentally doing a backward roll off the sofa or giving you the beady eye as you scoff down a bacon sandwich without offering them any, dogs will constantly have you chuckling at their antics. And nothing beats a bit of laughter.</p>
